# House Price Prediction

This project predicts housing sale prices using data from the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

The datasets **train.csv** and **test.csv**, as well as the text file **data_description.txt** can be found on the competitions page.


## Project Overview

Main notebook containing whole process with:
- EDA, data cleaning and feature engineering
- Model training with different types of models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Final predictions

Secondary notebook with:
- Streamlined data processing
- Chosen model training
- Final predictions


## Folder Structure

- `data/`: raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
- `src/`: Python scripts for reusable code
- `models/`: saved trained models
- `outputs/`: prediction results


## How to Run

All code can be sequentially executed in the notebooks.
File paths are relative and should work with the same folder structure.
